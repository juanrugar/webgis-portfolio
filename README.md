# My WebGIS Dossier
A website to showcase WebGIS projects developed using several Mapping GIS libraries. 
I developed some of them as assigment projects for my MsC in GIS Technologies at the UPC, come from my freelancing period.
This is my presentation as a webGIS developer and GIS Analyst.
Welcome and try all out, and report any glitch, bug, or fail you find, please.
Thanks for passing by!
